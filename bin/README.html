  <h1>CSCI 515 Compiler Design Utilities</h1>

  <p>These bash scripts will save you many hours.  <b>Make sure you learn to use them.</b></p>
<p>This <i>bin</i> directory is include in <a href="../downloads">downloads/gpl.tar</a></p>
<p>Make sure you set up your shell $PATH variable so that you can use these scripts (add "PATH=$PATH:~/515/bin" to ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc if you put the bin directory in ~/515).  Ask for help if you can't set your path correctly (it is correct if "$ which gt" returns the directory where you put the gt script).</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>gt/test_p2</b>  gpl tests scripts (test_p2 or p2, gt for p3 - p8)<br><br>
  execute gt and test_p2 in a phase src directory (e.g. 515/p5) and it will execute all the 
  tests in the <i>tests</i> directory and tell you if you passed or failed the test.

If you have never used one of my testing scripts, <a href="../../general/how_to_test.html">reading about how it works may save you time.</a><br><br>

  </li>
  <li><b>vd</b>  script shows you why you failed the standard output of a test using the vimdif utility to compare your output to the correct output
<pre><blockquote>
Example: You failed the standard output (stdout) on test t005 (as shown above)

$ vd 05

If tests/t005.out and results/t005.myout are different, vimdiff is started:

$ vimdiff tests/t005.out results/t005.myout

You will be using the vim editor to view the changes.  You can move around the files using the arrows.  You can exit vimdiff by typing ":qa" and then pressing the enter key.

If tests/t005.out and results/t005.myout are the same, a message is printed

</blockquote></pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>vde</b>  just like vd (above) but compares the standard error (stderr) files<br>
<pre><blockquote>
Example:

You failed the standard error on test t005 (as shown above)

$ vde 05

If tests/t005.err and results/t005.myerr are different, vimdiff is started:

$ vimdiff tests/t005.err results/t005.myerr

If tests/t005.err and results/t005.myerr are the same, a message is printed

</blockquote></pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>gitignore</b> this is the .gitignore you MUST use for phases p2-p8.  See the <a href="../git.html">git instructions.</a>  The gpl.tar file also puts it in gpl/.gitignore (where it belongs).
